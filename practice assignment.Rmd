## 2. Data Inspection

First, I will inpsect the Titanic dataset:

```r
Titanic ##prints Titanic to the console
```

```
## , , Age = Child, Survived = No
## 
##       Sex
## Class  Male Female
##   1st     0      0
##   2nd     0      0
##   3rd    35     17
##   Crew    0      0
## 
## , , Age = Adult, Survived = No
## 
##       Sex
## Class  Male Female
##   1st   118      4
##   2nd   154     13
##   3rd   387     89
##   Crew  670      3
## 
## , , Age = Child, Survived = Yes
## 
##       Sex
## Class  Male Female
##   1st     5      1
##   2nd    11     13
##   3rd    13     14
##   Crew    0      0
## 
## , , Age = Adult, Survived = Yes
## 
##       Sex
## Class  Male Female
##   1st    57    140
##   2nd    14     80
##   3rd    75     76
##   Crew  192     20
```

Then I will covert the array into a dataframe using the following code:

```r
t <- data.frame(Titanic) ## This code allows me to convert the Titanic data into a dataframe I've called "t"
```

## 2.1. Passenger Breakdown

Before I begin to answer these questions I will first inspect "t" visually:

```r
str(t) ## This command allows me to see the internal strucutre of the object "t"
```

```
## 'data.frame':	32 obs. of  5 variables:
##  $ Class   : Factor w/ 4 levels "1st","2nd","3rd",..: 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 ...
##  $ Sex     : Factor w/ 2 levels "Male","Female": 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 ...
##  $ Age     : Factor w/ 2 levels "Child","Adult": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 ...
##  $ Survived: Factor w/ 2 levels "No","Yes": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
##  $ Freq    : num  0 0 35 0 0 0 17 0 118 154 ...
```



**How many children and adults were on the Titantic?**

```r
library(plyr) ##This loads the plyr package, a very useful package contating the "count" function

count(t, "Age") ##Provides a summary table of the the number of males and females aboard.
```

```
##     Age freq
## 1 Child   16
## 2 Adult   16
```

Based on the table there are **16 adults and 16 children.**


**Were there more female adult or male adult passengers?**

To answer this question we will have to subset the dataframe to only contain the adults.

```r
ta <- subset(t, Age == "Adult") ##This creates a new object "ta" (for Titanic Adults) which contains only the data from the adults in the orginal object "t"
str(ta) ## Print the object to ensure command worked
```

```
## 'data.frame':	16 obs. of  5 variables:
##  $ Class   : Factor w/ 4 levels "1st","2nd","3rd",..: 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 ...
##  $ Sex     : Factor w/ 2 levels "Male","Female": 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 ...
##  $ Age     : Factor w/ 2 levels "Child","Adult": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...
##  $ Survived: Factor w/ 2 levels "No","Yes": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 ...
##  $ Freq    : num  118 154 387 670 4 13 89 3 57 14 ...
```

Now, we can peform the same count function as before to answer the question:

```r
count(ta, "Sex") ##Using the same count function on the object "ta" (adults only) summarizing using the variable "Sex"
```

```
##      Sex freq
## 1   Male    8
## 2 Female    8
```

Based on the summary table there are **8 adult females and 8 adult males.**

## 2.2 Survival

**Did the children have better surival rate than adults?**

To answer this question we will have to subset the data again into a dataframe which only contains children. The syntax is similar to 2.1.

```r
tc <- subset(t, Age == "Child") ##This creates a new object "tc" (for Titanic Child) which contains only the data from the child in the orginal object "t"
str(tc) ## Inpsect the internal strucutre of the objcet "tc"
```

```
## 'data.frame':	16 obs. of  5 variables:
##  $ Class   : Factor w/ 4 levels "1st","2nd","3rd",..: 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 ...
##  $ Sex     : Factor w/ 2 levels "Male","Female": 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 ...
##  $ Age     : Factor w/ 2 levels "Child","Adult": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
##  $ Survived: Factor w/ 2 levels "No","Yes": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 ...
##  $ Freq    : num  0 0 35 0 0 0 17 0 5 11 ...
```

We will then run the count command again for both the adult and child subsets

```r
count(tc, "Survived") ##Using the same count function on the object "tc" (children only) summarizing using the variable "Survived"
```

```
##   Survived freq
## 1       No    8
## 2      Yes    8
```

Based on the summary table we can calculate, using simple math, that **children had a 50% survial rate (8/16 survived).**


```r
count(ta, "Survived") ##Using the same count function on the object "ta" (adults only) summarizing using the variable "Survied"
```

```
##   Survived freq
## 1       No    8
## 2      Yes    8
```

Based on the summary table we can see that the adults also had a 50% survival rate.

**Which class of passengers had a better survival rate?**

In order to answer this question I could use the same apporoach as above (ie. subsetting for each individual class), however that is fairly cumbersome as the number of subsets increases. I will answer this quesiton using a simplified syntax.

```r
count(t, c("Class", "Survived")) ##This is a modified use of the "count" function in which I've sorted the survival counts by class.
```

```
##   Class Survived freq
## 1   1st       No    4
## 2   1st      Yes    4
## 3   2nd       No    4
## 4   2nd      Yes    4
## 5   3rd       No    4
## 6   3rd      Yes    4
## 7  Crew       No    4
## 8  Crew      Yes    4
```

Based on the output **each of the 4 classes had a survival rate of 50%.**

## 3. Data Visualization

First I will read in the dataset from a text file and assign it as an object ("g" for guinea pig. Note that the file has been downloaded from the STAT 540 github site and saved in this directory.

```r
g<- read.table("guinea_pigs_tooth_growth.txt", header = TRUE) ##Read in the table and save it as an object g, header= TRUE tells R that the first row of the table is a header.
```

Now that the dataset has been read into R I can create a graph. I will create a boxplot showing the distribution of odontoblast lengths for each vitamin C dosage level.

```r
boxplot(len~dose, data = g) ##This creates a fairly basic plot. I will add the labels next.
```

![](Assignment_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

To add the labels I will modify the command's syntax:

```r
boxplot(len~dose, data = g, xlab = "Vitamin C Dosage (mg/day)", ylab = "Odontoblast Length") ##Adding axis labels to the plot.
```

![](Assignment_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

Based on this grpah it is clear that there is a general dose-dependent relationship between vitamin C dosage and odontoblast length. The thick black-line in the middle of each box represents the median value while the box iteslef represents the interquartile range, and the whiskers denote the maximum and minimum values (as there are no outlying points beyond them).

I chose to represent the data in this way as I feel that it is the most informative first step. Using this plot one could quickly deduce if there is some sort of relationship between dosage and tooth size. My next step would be to subset the data into each of the delivery modes (orange juice or ascorbic acid) and create similar boxplot as above for each. This would allow me to discover if one delivery method is more effective than the other.
